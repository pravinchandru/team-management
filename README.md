# Duration

I took around 8 hours split over Saturday, Sunday and Monday (Nov 16,17,18) to complete the assignment.





# Tools
I used the following tools for the project.
- Claude: Used Claude3.5 Sonnet for building the skeleton of codebase. Leaned a bit more FE codebase on the tests, as I was a lil unfamiliar with React and styling.
- Sublime editor.
- Django, React
